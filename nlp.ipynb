method was tending to produce bipartite stemmas regardless of the actual history of the witnesses.,\n He suspected that editors tended to favor trees with two branches, as this would maximize the opportunities for editorial judgment (as there would be no third branch to \"break the tie\" whenever the witnesses disagreed).,\n He also noted that, for many works, more than one reasonable stemma
